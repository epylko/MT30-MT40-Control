# MT30-MT40-Control

When I'm away from my office, I like to turn off my devices around my desk. I have a MT40 device that I can control through the Meraki app on my phone, however that is a bit cumbersome.
With the MT30, I setup a double long press to turn off the power. I didn't want someone to accidentally push and hold the button and shut things down. A short press will turn everything on.

This uses a python virtual environment.
